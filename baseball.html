			<blockquote>...The Globe's resident Daisuke-ologist, Daigo Fujiwara, has calculated that Matsuzaka has thrown more pitches this season (3,125) than he did all of last season in Japan (2,770), and his 29 starts are more than he's had in any previous season except 2001, when he made 33.</blockquote></li>

			<blockquote>Daigo Fujiwara, the Globe's resident Daisuke-ologist, notes that while Matsuzaka is celebrated for his win over Cuba in the World Baseball Classic, his postseason record in the Japan Series was not particularly impressive: 1-3, 7.52 ERA, 21 whiffs, 9 walks (6 hit batsmen), and 3 home runs allowed in 20 1/3 innings.</blockquote></li>

			<blockquote>The Globe's resident Daisuke-ologist, Daigo Fujiwara, researched that Matsuzaka lasted two-thirds of an inning against the Softbank Hawks July 13, 2003, and gave up seven runs (five earned) in the shortest start of his career. He's had other stinkers, including back-to-back starts in 2004 against Orix (April 29 and May 5), in which he gave up 10 runs and nine runs respectively.</blockquote></li>
